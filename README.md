React.js, Material UI, and just a couple of other dependencies, you'll build everything else from scratch!

In this project used:-
- React functional components and their reusability.
- React functional Hooks.
- React file and folder structure
- I achieve mastery using Material UI (version 5)
- And most importantly, fetching data from unlimited sources using RapidAPI.
